about: |
  I am currently a Business Analyst at Capital One in NYC, where I work mostly with Python and SQL. I recently graduated from the University of Virginia, where I studied Information Technology at the McIntire School of Commerce. I minored in Computer Science and discovered a genuine enjoyment in coding in the second half of my studies. I took as many Computer Science classes as my schedule allowed, and I am continuing to learn however I can through reading and doing. My goal is to find work either as a software engineer or as a product manager.
